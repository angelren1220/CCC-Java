# 22_S1 Problem: Good Fours and Good Fives

## Objective:
Understand and implement a solution to calculate the number of ways a given number can be formed by the sum of 4s and 5s.

## Problem Summary:
Finn loves the numbers 4 and 5 and wants to know how many different ways he can represent a given number using just these two numbers.

## Key Concepts:
- Modular Arithmetic: The % operator gives the remainder of a division. If N % 5 == 0, N is a multiple of 5.
- Looping: A while loop can iterate as long as a condition is true.
- Conditionals: An if statement allows us to check if a condition is true and perform an action based on that.

## Approach:
1. Start with the given number N.
2. Decrease N by 4 in each iteration of the loop.
3. If at any point the remaining N is a multiple of 5, we have found a valid combination.
4. The loop ends when N is less than 0.
5. The total number of valid combinations is the solution.

## Sample:
Input: 20
Output: 2
Explanation: 20 can be formed by (4+4+4+4+4) or (5+5+5+5).

# 22_S2 Problem: Good Groups

## Objective:
Learn to solve a constraint satisfaction problem where we need to count the number of constraints violated based on group formations.

## Problem Summary:
A class is divided into groups of three, but some students have constraints that they must or must not be grouped together.

## Key Concepts:
- Data Structures: Understanding the use of maps to store relationships.
- String Manipulation: Creating a consistent key from two strings.
- Algorithmic Thinking: Iterating through groups to check against the constraints.

## Approach:
1. Read the constraints into two maps: one for students who must be together (mustBeSame), and another for those who must not (mustNotBeSame).
2. Generate a unique key for every pair of students to track if they are placed in the same group or not.
3. Iterate through each group of students, updating the maps based on the groups formed.
4. Count the number of times the constraints are violated: when a 'must be same' pair is not in the same group or a 'must not be same' pair is in the same group.

## Sample Problem:
Input:
3
ALICE BOB
BOB CHARLIE
ALICE CHARLIE
0
1
ALICE BOB CHARLIE

Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs (ALICE-BOB, BOB-CHARLIE, ALICE-CHARLIE) have a 'must be together' constraint, but they cannot all be satisfied in a single group of three.
