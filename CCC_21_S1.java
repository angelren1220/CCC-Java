// Read the first line to get the number of pieces of wood, N.
// Read the second line to get the heights of the pieces of wood into an array heights, which will have N+1 elements.
// Read the third line to get the widths of the pieces of wood into an array widths, which will have N elements.
// 2. Calculate Area of Each Piece:

// Iterate through each piece of wood.
// Calculate the area of each trapezoid using the formula area = (a + b) / 2 * h, where a and b are the heights of the left and right sides of a piece of wood, and h is the width.
// 3. Sum Areas:

// Accumulate the areas of all the pieces to get the total area.
// 4. Output the Result:

// Print out the total area.
